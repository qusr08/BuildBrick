<!-- 

To Do:
- Building *
    - Ability to place brick
    - Ability to cycle through brick color
    - Ability to reset build area
- Sound Effects *
    - https://www.google.com/search?q=lego+brick+sound+effects&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS862US862&oq=lego+brick+sound+effects&aqs=chrome..69i57.3304j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
    - When moving brick and swapping brick color (can use the same sound effect)
    - When placing brick
    - When clearing build area
- Saving creations *
    - Set url to the brick data and read it on webpage load (this way people can share anything they made simply by a link)
        - https://www.sitepoint.com/get-url-parameters-with-javascript/
        - For each block: XXYYZZCC
- Get Ardiuno to control website *
    - Parse input from sensors

- Constrain camera controls?
    - Fixed camera?
    - Would also make controls easier to use
    - Maybe do a view mode a build mode, where when building you can place blocks and the camera is fixed, and in view mode the camera circles around the creation
